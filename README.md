BitBox
======

[prettyrpc.py] -- a better RPC :) A pair of classes that allow positional parameters in XMLRPC method calls. They also allow passing python objects as parameters to XMLRPC calls. They also help to avoid unintentional parameters modifications by XMLRPC (like removing newlines etc.).

[multitest.py]  -- metaclass/base class to generate multiple tests with the similar steps but different parameters in each test.

[bitbox.py] -- just playing with bit operations.
